# Orbital Blitz
Orbital blitz is a racing game made by students of Epitech Lyon using Unity3D. This was our first Unity Project. It includes procedural generation of circuits and AIs trained with reinforcement learning.

It is playable here (not working properly with Edge) : https://5.39.76.139/

# Procedural Generation

The generation algorithm relies on the backtracking algorithm define a random path on a grid. Discontinuity is added by breaking up the generated path. A mesh is then extruded based on the final path.

# Reinforcement Learning

AIs have been trained using the MLagents library on our procedurally generated circuits.  

# Virtual Reality

The VR build of the game is available on the website ("VR Desktop" / "VR APK" in the navbar -> https://5.39.76.139/)
